This repo contains the source materials for my personal website that is updated periodically. I use Netlify to source the website https://www.mattwoodstock.com The website will automatically rebuild from this repository, but the website only displays the information in the /docs directory. To edit pages from this website, the .qmd files need to be revised and the website needs to be rendered, which I typically do on my local machine in RStudio and then commit all changes to this repository.
