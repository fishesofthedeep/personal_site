Carbon export modeling is generally an extension of bioenergetic modeling, applying energetic rates with life history parameters to estimate carbon ingestion and release. Through this effort, I have developed a trait-based model that runs on an individual scale, allowing for comparisons among species and size classes. In the oceanic Gulf of Mexico, the mesopelagic micronekton fish community actively transports between 11 and 24% of the total dissolved organic carbon in the water column each year, an act primarily led by lanternfishes. Ongoing efforts aim to improve on the model structure (R-based), incorporate new processes, and refine carbon export estimates for the carbon export of mesopelagic fishes in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n## Publications\n* **Woodstock, M.S.**, T.T.
