However, internal parasites can provide insight into the trophic structure of an ecosystem, such as the specificity of predator diets, and foodweb topology. I compared the diet and parasite communities of 26 mesopelagic fish species from the Gulf of Mexico. Unlike other ecosystems, the parasite community of the deep-pelagic zone was very scarce, and only 1 in every 10 fishes contained a single parasite. However, I was still able to gather evidence that predators of fishes and squids were more likely to be infected by a parasite than predators of small zooplankton, and the parasite community of a fish species was influenced by the diet of that species, suggesting some degree of specificity among mesopelagic fish diets.\n\n\n## Publications\n* **Woodstock, M.S.**, C.A.
