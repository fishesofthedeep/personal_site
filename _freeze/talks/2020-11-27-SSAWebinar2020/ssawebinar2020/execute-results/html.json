What differentiates statistics from data science? And how does the design of experiments fit in with data science?\n\n In this webinar, I will talk about the concept of the \"grammar\" and the momentum it is gaining to make data analysis more accessible to a diverse group. I'll then present my prototype to the \"grammar of experimental design\" - a framework to construct the design of comparative experiments that cognitively enforces the experimental structure. I'll explain some principles behind this prototype, showcase how my developmental R-package edibble will work, and how I think it helps to bridge the gap between experimental design theory and practice for the wider community.\nHost: Statistical Society of Australia Webinar Series\nauthor:\n  - name: Emi Tanaka\n    url: https://emitanaka.org\n    affiliation: Monash University\n    affiliation_url: https://numbat.space/\ndate: 11-27-2020\nurl: https://emitanaka.org/slides/SSA2020\nimage: cover.png\ncategories: [Experimental Design]\n---\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n\n## Errata\n\nThere was an error in my script (where duplicates were not removed) for the count for the number of R packages in CRAN Task View of Design of Experiments. The slides specify there are about 200 R-packages. After removing duplicates, there was about 100 R-packages. \n\n:::\n\nClick [here](https://emitanaka.org/slides/SSA2020) for the link to the slide. \n\n<iframe src=\"https://emitanaka.org/slides/SSA2020#2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450px\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n",
