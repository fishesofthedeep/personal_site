:::


I'm an Assistant Scientist at the [Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/) working closely with the [NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center).

My **research interests** are:

* [Ecosystem-based modeling]{.highlight-color} of aquatic systems
* Comparisons of [ecosystem functioning]{.highlight-color} across ecosystem borders
* [Network Analysis]{.highlight-color}
* [Consumer-mediated nutrient transport modeling]{.highlight-color}
* [Trophic ecology]{.highlight-color} of oceanic fishes
* [Data visualization]{.highlight-color} and [visual inference]{.highlight-color}

I am proficient in **R** (base + tidyverse), **Julia**, **Primer**, and **Ecopath with Ecosim** and have working knowledge of **Bash**, **OSMOSE** (Java-based), **QGIS** (Python-based) and **Atlantis**. I've lived in the United States my entire life, but have bounced around Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Florida, Maryland, and Massachusetts. My PhD, obtained at Florida International University in 2022, is in Biological Sciences with most of my code written in **R**. For the creation of this website, I also gained the experience of some front-end web development (**HTML/CSS/JS**).


I am a big advocate of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and I try to deposit my code on **GitHub**. Please contact me for any code that you may like to utilize and/or any potential collaborations.
