## Synopsis of Work
Trophic ecology studies in the mesopelagic zone generally center around diet composition or stable isotopes. However, internal parasites can provide insight into the trophic structure of an ecosystem, such as the specificity of predator diets, and foodweb topology. I compared the diet and parasite communities of 26 mesopelagic fish species from the Gulf of Mexico. Unlike other ecosystems, the parasite community of the deep-pelagic zone was very scarce, and only 1 in every 10 fishes contained a single parasite. However, I was still able to gather evidence that predators of fishes and squids were more likely to be infected by a parasite than predators of small zooplankton, and the parasite community of a fish species was influenced by the diet of that species, suggesting some degree of specificity among mesopelagic fish diets.
