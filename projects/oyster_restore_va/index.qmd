## Synopsis of Work
Oysters and seagrass provide a wide suite of benefits to the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, but these foundational habitats have been reduced by overharvesting, climate change, and poor water quality conditions. An extensive restoration effort is ongoing to restore 10 Chesapeake Bay tributaries by 2025, two of which being the York and Piankatank Rivers in Virginia's Middle Peninsula. Meanwhile, seagrass monitoring surveys have shown little recovery of the once dominant Eelgrass (<i>Zostera marina</i>). Two ecosystem models are being developed with the [Ecopath with Ecosim](www.ecopath.org) software to simulate the effects of varying degrees of habitat change within the system. The results will be input into an economic-impact model modified to fit the  expenditures of local, commercial fishers in order to estimate the regional economic impacts of oyster restoration and seagrass die-off in the Virginia Middle Peninsula and provide Managers with an estimation of the benefits associated with restoration.
